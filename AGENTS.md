# SwiftUIRegistry agent guide

## Purpose

Validate a native first, source owned, registry driven SwiftUI composition layer. Version 0 stays small.

One loop: edit `Registry/sources/` and `Registry/items/`, validate, regenerate `docs/catalog/`, reinstall into the Showcase, compile, verify visually. Everything downstream of metadata is derived. You MUST NOT hand edit it.

## Document map

Each fact has one home in four classes.

Contracts:

| File | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| this file | developing the registry |
| `docs/philosophy.md` | why |
| `docs/architecture.md` | how |
| `docs/registry-spec.md` | data and installer contract; "Agent usage" covers a consuming app |
| `docs/visual-testing.md` | visual evidence rules |
| `docs/mango.md` | the design system template |

State: `CHANGELOG.md` alone holds what shipped and the known limitations. A status claim elsewhere is a pointer.

Generated, MUST NOT hand edit:

| Path | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/catalog/` | markdown catalog |
| `Website/content/registry.json` | site data |
| `Website/content/docs/` | changelog and contracts copied for the site's Docs pages |
| `Website/public/images/` | site captures |
| `Examples/Showcase/.../RegistryCatalogManifest.swift`, `Examples/Showcase/SwiftUIRegistryShowcaseUITests/RegistryItemNames.swift` | Showcase manifest |
| `Sources/SwiftUIRegistryDesignSurface/RegistryItemTokens.swift` | item to token map that scopes the design surface's panel |
| `docs/images/items/`, `docs/images/themes/` | captures |

Counts and per item pages live there, not in prose. `Website/` is Next.js with shadcn/ui; its hand written docs pages sit in `Website/docs/`.

Archives: 7 closed dated records (roadmap, research records, direction review, Stage 1 validation, clean room trial, CLI migration contract, handoff brief). They sit untracked in `~/Projects/swiftui-cn-local/` beside an `INDEX.md`. `CHANGELOG.md` carries what an adopter needs from them.

Conflicts: state beats archives, the later archive wins, contracts govern rules. Surface the conflict and fix the stale text. MUST NOT average.

## Boundaries

- `Sources/SwiftUIRegistryFoundations/`: stable interface, design foundations only.
- `Sources/SwiftUIRegistryDesignSurface/`: optional product: tuning panel, preset codec, `designSurface()`, the `design-tokens.json` store on `swift-sharing`. Compiles only with UIKit, inert in release. Depends on foundations, never on items (native chrome). The Showcase consumes it; its tests run through the Showcase scheme, since the root package builds it empty on macOS.
- `Sources/RegistryKit/`: SwiftUI free engine behind `swiftui-registry` (`Sources/SwiftUIRegistryCLI/`): loading, the single structural validator, resolution, receipts, install and merge, search, preset codes, the MCP server, the generators. Never imports `SwiftUIRegistryFoundations`. Contracts and captured fixtures: `Tests/RegistryKitTests/`.
- `Registry/sources/components/`: source owned styles, focused modifiers, reusable compositions.
- `Registry/sources/blocks/`: source owned compositions of components.
- `Registry/items/`: metadata and the dependency graph. `Registry/preset_vectors.json` pins the codes every codec reproduces.
- `Distribution/homebrew/`: the tap's formula template. `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds the universal binary on a GitHub release. Neither is in the verification list.
- `Examples/TodoCounter/`: second consumer from a fresh Xcode project: package by URL, the Composable Architecture, 7 items installed with the released tool, a customized preset theme, 1 locally edited component. Not in the verification list; its test plan runs from its workspace.
- `Examples/Showcase/`: proves installation, integration, and the visual contracts. Components, Blocks, and Recipes tabs beside the tuning panel; item list and usage snippets from the generated manifest. Every item has a demo in `ItemDemos.swift`; `-item <name>` renders one alone for capture.
- `Skills/`: 3 agent skills, mirrored to `~/.claude/skills/`. They quote the tool's help and the catalog; regenerate them when either changes.

## Rules

- Keep raw controls and containers visible at the call site. Style protocols set appearance; a focused `ViewModifier` adds optional behavior. MUST NOT wrap an Apple control only to rename it.
- Configure views with prepared values, bindings, actions, and defaults. Use `@ViewBuilder` when a container wraps caller content in structure or chrome.
- Prefer a modifier over a parameter for an independent optional decoration or behavior.
- One home per concern:

  | Concern | Home |
  | --- | --- |
  | content, bindings, actions, required accessibility input | the initializer |
  | variant, tone, tint, a future size or emphasis | a `registry` prefixed copy and return method, before generic modifiers |
  | presentation of a native control | a `registry` style |
  | a text treatment | a `registry` modifier with a variant argument |
  | the theme | the environment |
  | sizes | Apple's `controlSize` |
  | an optional decoration outside internal layout | a `ViewModifier` |

  Example: `InlineAlert(...) { }.registryVariant(.positive)`.

- Controlled state stays with the caller through bindings. A component MAY own transient `@State` only for a self contained interaction.
- Registry source MUST NOT import app architecture, networking, or persistence libraries.
- A copied item stays understandable alone; metadata lists every source dependency.
- Use semantic tokens, not repeated hardcoded colors or metrics. Add a token only when 2 real items need it.
- A treatment stays source owned until 2 items share it exactly; only then consider foundations.
- Respect environment values and layout proposals: Dynamic Type, color scheme, layout direction, enabled state, flexible parent sizing. MUST NOT hardcode one context.
- Require accessibility input that visible content cannot supply. An icon only control's label MUST NOT be optional.
- Preview every meaningful variant, including dark appearance and an accessibility Dynamic Type size.
- A new reusable abstraction needs 2 concrete consumers or named roadmap usages.
- Every installable component or block needs a version, preview, accessibility notes, platform metadata, and a compile path. A `recipe` installs nothing: empty `files`, non empty `docs`, no preview. No installable item MAY depend on a recipe (value gate, `docs/registry-spec.md`).
- Every installable item applies `.registryItem("<name>")` once, last in its root view's or style's chain. For an item exposed through an extension, that chain is a private modifier's `body`. The tag is foundations API, inert without a surface. The validator rejects a foundations dependent item whose first source lacks it.
- Every item needs a non empty `usage` snippet quoted from its canonical public API, never from memory. A recipe reuses the native snippet from its `docs`.
- Four generators, four outputs:

  | Command | Output |
  | --- | --- |
  | `swift run swiftui-registry generate catalog` | `docs/catalog/` |
  | `swift run swiftui-registry generate site-data` | website data |
  | `swift run swiftui-registry generate showcase-manifest` | Showcase manifest |
  | `swift run swiftui-registry generate item-tokens` | item to token map |

  `item-tokens` scans each item's sources and dependency closure for the theme fields they read. Regenerate all four after any metadata or source change; `generatedOutputsMatchCanonicalBytes` in `Tests/RegistryKitTests/GeneratorTests.swift` rejects drift byte for byte. `Website/app` is hand written React over that JSON and `Website/content/docs/`; `npm run build` in `Website/` exports it statically.

- Item screenshots come from `python3 Scripts/capture_previews.py` on the pinned simulator, never hand made. Recapture after a visible change, then regenerate the catalog and site.
- MUST NOT regenerate a visual reference merely to pass a test (`docs/visual-testing.md`).
- Add a dependency only when a vertical slice proves it necessary.
- `Sources/RegistryKit/Validation.swift` is the only place that enforces registry structure (Validation, `docs/registry-spec.md`).

## Environment pins

| Pin | Value |
| --- | --- |
| visual contract and UI tests | light mode iPhone 17, iOS 27.0, UDID `1807166B-C557-4F6B-B177-D5F3F701CBD7` (`docs/visual-testing.md`) |
| capture launch arguments | `-AppleLanguages (en) -AppleLocale en_US` |
| wide block captures | iPad Pro 13 inch, also `en_US` (`ar_SA` until 2026-09-06) |
| toolchain | Xcode 27.0, Swift 6.4 |
| CI | GitHub `macos-26` image, default Xcode 26.6, Swift tools 6.2 (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) |
| package identity | `swiftui-ui-registry` at `github.com/mangobyte-dev/swiftui-ui-registry` |
| published tags | `0.1.0` (2026-09-06), `0.2.0` (2026-09-07), each with a GitHub release and the Homebrew tap |

The launch arguments keep dates, currency, and the calendar in an image independent of the region; the iPad's status bar date comes from the device, hence its pin. No iOS 26 runtime is installed. A floor 26 claim rests on compilation plus iOS 27 runtime evidence. CI runs the registry gate, the website build, and a secret scan on every push and pull request. `0.3.0` adds the design surface's foundations API and the second product. Every installable item therefore declares the `0.3.0` floor (`docs/registry-spec.md`).

## Verification

Run from the root, cheapest first:

```sh
swift build
swift run swiftui-registry validate
swift run swiftui-registry generate catalog
swift run swiftui-registry generate showcase-manifest
swift run swiftui-registry generate site-data
swift run swiftui-registry generate item-tokens
git diff --exit-code -- docs/catalog Examples/Showcase Website/content Sources/SwiftUIRegistryDesignSurface/RegistryItemTokens.swift
swift test
make format-check
swift run swiftui-registry search nutrition dashboard --kind block --platform iOS --target-version 26.0
swift run swiftui-registry install finance-overview --destination Examples/Showcase/SwiftUIRegistryShowcasePackage/Sources/SwiftUIRegistryShowcaseFeature/Installed --force
swift run swiftui-registry install nutrition-overview --destination Examples/Showcase/SwiftUIRegistryShowcasePackage/Sources/SwiftUIRegistryShowcaseFeature/Installed
xcodebuildmcp simulator build --workspace-path Examples/Showcase/SwiftUIRegistryShowcase.xcworkspace --scheme SwiftUIRegistryShowcase --simulator-name 'iPhone 17'
xcodebuildmcp simulator test --workspace-path Examples/Showcase/SwiftUIRegistryShowcase.xcworkspace --scheme SwiftUIRegistryShowcase --simulator-id 1807166B-C557-4F6B-B177-D5F3F701CBD7
(cd Website && npm ci && npm run typecheck && npm run build)
```

Scope to the change: metadata only stops after `make format-check`; registry source needs the install and compile steps; only a visible UI change needs the simulator test; a change under `Website/` needs the typecheck and build. `swift test` needs `git` and Node 22 on PATH (`git merge-file`; `Website/lib/preset.ts` under `node --experimental-strip-types`). A visible item change also needs `python3 Scripts/capture_previews.py <item>`, then the four generators. That is the one remaining Python script; it lists items through the built tool. A change is incomplete if generated source differs from registry source or any command fails. Name a skipped step in the done claim.
