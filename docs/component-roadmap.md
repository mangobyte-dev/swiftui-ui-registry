# Component roadmap

## Goal

Build a shadcn-inspired SwiftUI component catalog from Apple primitives, then compose those components into product blocks

A component does not replace a native control. `Button`, `TextField`, `Toggle`, `Picker`, `Menu`, `ProgressView`, `ScrollView`, `NavigationStack`, and system presentations remain visible at the call site. The registry standardizes them with SwiftUI style protocols, focused `ViewModifier`s, semantic theme values, and small compositions where one primitive is insufficient

## Inventory source

This inventory was captured on 2026-08-29 with shadcn CLI 4.19.0:

```sh
npx shadcn@latest search @shadcn --type ui --limit 100 --offset 0 --json
```

The command returned 61 `registry:ui` items and `hasMore: false`. Styles, examples, and `registry:block` entries are intentionally excluded. Re-run the command before starting a stage and review additions or removals explicitly

## Implementation rules

1. Keep the Apple primitive visible at the call site. Prefer `.buttonStyle(...)`, `.toggleStyle(...)`, `.textFieldStyle(...)`, `.labelStyle(...)`, `.progressViewStyle(...)`, and focused view modifiers
2. Use `@ViewBuilder` when a composition provides consistent structure or chrome around arbitrary caller content. Use a fixed composition only when several primitives must cooperate, such as an input group, OTP entry, command palette, attachment, or message
3. Keep caller-controlled state external through bindings. A component may own transient `@State` only when the interaction is self-contained and no caller, block, restoration flow, or product rule must coordinate it
4. Components accept prepared values and actions and do not import application architecture, networking, or persistence
5. Keep system-owned presentation and interaction behavior. Style sheet content, menu labels, rows, and triggers without replacing `.sheet`, `.alert`, `.popover`, `Menu`, navigation, scrolling, focus, or selection
6. Prefer a focused modifier for independent optional behavior instead of expanding an initializer with unrelated parameters
7. Give optional parameters sensible defaults so the common case stays concise
8. Use semantic foundation tokens instead of repeated hardcoded colors and metrics. Add a token after at least two completed items need the same meaning. Keep a style or modifier source-owned until two items use the exact same treatment
9. Respect Dynamic Type, color scheme, layout direction, enabled state, and parent layout proposals. Require accessibility input when it cannot be derived from visible content
10. Preview every meaningful variant, including dark appearance and an accessibility Dynamic Type size
11. Do not add a helper abstraction inside an item without two concrete consumers or named block usages
12. Every completed item needs registry metadata, realistic previews, accessibility notes, RTL and large-text coverage, installation into Showcase, and a compile path at the declared platform floor
13. Blocks begin only after their component dependency closure is complete

## Stage 1: Core styled primitives

**Status: Complete**

All 21 items are indexed, source-owned, installed into Showcase, and compiled at the iOS 18 platform floor. Native-only `aspect-ratio` and `direction` remain documented usage examples rather than replacement APIs. Launch Showcase with `-stage-one` to inspect the catalog

Establish the visual language and the APIs that later stages depend on

| shadcn item | Raw SwiftUI base | Registry implementation |
|---|---|---|
| `aspect-ratio` | Any `View` | Document and preview `.aspectRatio`; add no replacement type |
| `badge` | `Text` or `Label` | Focused badge modifier with semantic variants |
| `button` | `Button` | `ButtonStyle` variants for default, secondary, outline, ghost, destructive, and link treatments |
| `button-group` | `ControlGroup` | `ControlGroupStyle` or a group modifier using the same button variants |
| `card` | `GroupBox` | `GroupBoxStyle` for border, background, radius, and content spacing |
| `checkbox` | `Toggle` | Checkbox `ToggleStyle` while preserving the binding and control semantics |
| `input` | `TextField` and `SecureField` | `TextFieldStyle` for border, fill, focus, disabled, and invalid states |
| `label` | `Label` | `LabelStyle` variants for icon alignment and spacing |
| `progress` | `ProgressView` | Linear `ProgressViewStyle` and semantic tinting |
| `radio-group` | `Picker` | Picker styling for mutually exclusive options |
| `select` | `Picker` | Styled picker label and menu presentation |
| `separator` | `Divider` | Separator modifier for inset and orientation treatment |
| `slider` | `Slider` | Native slider with semantic tint, control sizing, labels, and value presentation |
| `spinner` | `ProgressView` | Circular progress styling and sizing |
| `switch` | `Toggle` | Switch `ToggleStyle` treatment |
| `tabs` | `Picker` or `TabView` | Segmented selection style for local tabs; retain `TabView` for app navigation |
| `textarea` | `TextEditor` | Focused editor modifier matching input states |
| `toggle` | `Toggle` | Button-like `ToggleStyle` variants |
| `toggle-group` | `Picker` or `ControlGroup` | Single-selection picker or multi-selection group using styled toggles |
| `native-select` | `Picker` | Minimal native picker treatment distinct from the richer `select` presentation |
| `direction` | `EnvironmentValues.layoutDirection` | Direction preview and semantic leading/trailing guidance; no visual replacement |

### Stage 1 exit criteria

- Every foundation token is used by at least two completed registry items with the same semantic meaning
- Enabled, pressed, focused, selected, disabled, and invalid states are demonstrated where applicable
- The showcase proves light, dark, RTL, and accessibility text sizes

## Stage 2: Forms and data entry compositions

Build higher-level input arrangements from the Stage 1 styles

| shadcn item | Raw SwiftUI base | Registry implementation |
|---|---|---|
| `calendar` | `DatePicker` and `MultiDatePicker` | Styled native calendar selection with single and multiple-date examples |
| `combobox` | `Picker`, `TextField`, `List`, and `.searchable` | Searchable selection composition with a binding and prepared options |
| `field` | `LabeledContent`, `Section`, `Label`, and content | Field layout composition for label, description, requirement, and validation message |
| `form` | `Form` | Form-level spacing and section treatment composed from styled fields |
| `input-group` | `TextField`, `Label`, and `Button` in a container | Leading and trailing accessory composition using Stage 1 input and button treatments |
| `input-otp` | `TextField` with one-time-code semantics | Accessible code-entry composition with a single binding and visual slots |
| `attachment` | `Label`, `Image`, `ProgressView`, and `Button` | Attachment composition with idle, uploading, processing, error, and completed states |

### Stage 2 exit criteria

- Focus order, keyboard behavior, validation announcements, autofill, and disabled states are verified
- Every composition accepts bindings and actions without owning validation, upload, or persistence logic

## Stage 3: Content and feedback

Standardize reusable content surfaces and nonmodal feedback

| shadcn item | Raw SwiftUI base | Registry implementation |
|---|---|---|
| `accordion` | `DisclosureGroup` | `DisclosureGroupStyle` for grouped expandable sections |
| `alert` | `Label`, `Text`, and optional `Button` | Inline alert composition with informational and destructive variants |
| `avatar` | `AsyncImage`, `Image`, or caller-provided content | Circular media composition with initials or symbol fallback |
| `breadcrumb` | `Button`, `Label`, and native navigation state | Compact hierarchy presentation for wide layouts; native back navigation remains authoritative |
| `collapsible` | `DisclosureGroup` | Single-region disclosure treatment distinct from grouped accordion styling |
| `empty` | `ContentUnavailableView` | Styled empty, search-empty, and recoverable-error content |
| `item` | `Label`, `LabeledContent`, `Button`, or `NavigationLink` | Row modifier for title, description, media, metadata, and actions |
| `kbd` | `Text` | Keycap modifier for keyboard shortcut hints |
| `marker` | `Label`, `Text`, and optional `Divider` | Muted annotation treatment with plain, separator, and bottom-border variants |
| `skeleton` | Any `View` with `.redacted(reason: .placeholder)` | Placeholder modifier that disables interaction and respects Reduce Motion |

### Stage 3 exit criteria

- Feedback is distinguishable without color alone
- Decorative imagery is hidden from accessibility and meaningful media has caller-provided labels
- Skeleton previews do not trigger product actions or effects

## Stage 4: Presentation and navigation adapters

Keep Apple’s presentation, menu, navigation, and scrolling behavior while standardizing the content placed inside it

| shadcn item | Raw SwiftUI base | Registry implementation |
|---|---|---|
| `alert-dialog` | `.alert` or `.confirmationDialog` | Usage pattern with button roles and prepared copy; system appearance remains untouched |
| `context-menu` | `.contextMenu` | Styled `Label` actions and role guidance |
| `dialog` | `.sheet` or `.alert` | Dialog content modifier and sizing guidance |
| `drawer` | `.sheet` with presentation detents | Bottom-sheet content treatment using native drag and dismissal behavior |
| `dropdown-menu` | `Menu` | Styled menu trigger and native action labels |
| `hover-card` | `.popover` | Pointer and focus-triggered informational popover where the platform supports it |
| `menubar` | Toolbar `Menu` on iOS | Menu grouping and label treatment; do not emulate a desktop menu bar on iPhone |
| `navigation-menu` | `NavigationStack`, `NavigationSplitView`, and `Menu` | Navigation label and section treatments around native containers |
| `pagination` | `Button`, `Picker`, `TabView`, or paged `ScrollView` | Bound page-control composition with native scrolling where content is swipeable |
| `popover` | `.popover` | Styled popover content and compact-adaptation guidance |
| `resizable` | `NavigationSplitView` | Platform-owned column behavior; do not recreate browser drag handles on iPhone |
| `scroll-area` | `ScrollView` or `List` | Content margins, indicators, clipping, and edge treatment modifiers |
| `sheet` | `.sheet` | Styled sheet content with native detents, drag indicator, and dismissal |
| `sidebar` | `NavigationSplitView` and `List` | Sidebar row and section styles using native selection and collapse behavior |
| `tooltip` | `.help`, `accessibilityHint`, and optional informational popover | Platform-adapted help without hover-only information |

### Stage 4 exit criteria

- Escape, dismissal, focus restoration, keyboard navigation, and VoiceOver order remain system-owned
- iPhone compact adaptation and iPad regular-width behavior are both demonstrated

## Stage 5: Complex interactive components

Implement the items that need coordinated behavior or framework-specific data

| shadcn item | Raw SwiftUI base | Registry implementation |
|---|---|---|
| `carousel` | Horizontal `ScrollView` with paging behavior | Generic paging composition with native scrolling, indicators, and Reduce Motion support |
| `chart` | Swift Charts `Chart` | Shared chart foreground, axis, legend, and tooltip treatments; chart semantics stay domain-specific |
| `command` | `TextField`, `List`, `.searchable`, and `.sheet` | Command palette composition with caller-provided commands and actions |
| `sonner` | Overlay, `Label`, and `Button` | Transient status presenter with queued messages, dismissal, and accessibility announcements |
| `table` | `Table`, `Grid`, or `List` | Header, row, selection, and compact-adaptation treatments around native containers |

### Stage 5 exit criteria

- Large datasets, empty results, keyboard interaction, selection, and reduced-motion behavior are covered
- Chart and table data remain caller-owned and strongly typed

## Stage 6: Messaging components

Complete the recent shadcn messaging primitives after the underlying styles are stable

| shadcn item | Raw SwiftUI base | Registry implementation |
|---|---|---|
| `bubble` | `Text`, caller content, and container modifiers | Aligned message bubble with default, secondary, muted, tinted, outline, ghost, and destructive treatments |
| `message` | `HStack`, `VStack`, avatar content, and bubble content | Message composition for alignment, avatar, header, body, and footer |
| `message-scroller` | `ScrollView` and `ScrollPosition` | Message viewport with bottom anchoring, new-message preservation, and scroll-to-edge control |

### Stage 6 exit criteria

- Incoming and outgoing alignment follows layout direction correctly
- Dynamic Type, long unbroken content, selection, VoiceOver reading order, and new-message scrolling are verified

## Blocks phase

After the component stages, add blocks only as source-owned compositions with explicit registry dependencies. Candidate first blocks:

1. Authentication form: `card`, `form`, `field`, `input`, `button`, `alert`
2. Settings section: `form`, `field`, `switch`, `select`, `separator`
3. Data table screen: `table`, `pagination`, `dropdown-menu`, `badge`, `skeleton`, `empty`
4. Command search: `command`, `dialog`, `input`, `item`, `kbd`, `empty`
5. Chat screen: `message-scroller`, `message`, `bubble`, `attachment`, `input-group`, `button`
6. Dashboard: `card`, `chart`, `tabs`, `select`, `table`, `badge`

A block does not introduce a new foundation token, component variant, or helper abstraction unless at least two real usages prove the need

## Delivery unit

Implement one dependency-closed vertical slice at a time. A stage may contain several slices, but each merged slice includes its style or modifier source, metadata, preview, accessibility notes, showcase installation, registry tests, and compile verification. Do not land placeholder component files or metadata-only entries
